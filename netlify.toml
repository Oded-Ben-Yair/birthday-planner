# Netlify configuration (ROOT Directory)
# Build command runs from root package.json located here.
# Source files are in the 'src/' directory within this root.

[build]
  # The build command to run (executed from this root directory).
  # Uses the 'build' script in the root package.json.
  command = "npm run build"

  # The directory (relative to this root) containing the deploy-ready static assets.
  # Since your source is in 'src/', Vite likely outputs to 'dist/' in this root directory.
  # Verify this in your 'vite.config.js' or 'vite.config.ts' if unsure ('build.outDir').
  publish = "dist"

# If you have Netlify serverless functions (Node.js/Go) in a specific directory
# relative to this root, uncomment and set the directory below.
# [functions]
#  directory = "netlify/functions"
```

**Key Changes:**
* **NO `base = "..."` line:** This is the critical fix for the error message you received.
* `publish = "dist"`: Assumes Vite builds into a `dist` folder in the root when run from the root.

**Step 2: Commit and Push the Change**

```bash
# Stage the corrected Netlify configuration file
git add netlify.toml

# Commit the change
git commit -m "fix: Remove incorrect base directory from netlify.toml"

# Push to the main branch
git push origin main
```

**Step 3: Redeploy on Netlify**

Trigger one more deployment on Netlify. This should resolve the configuration parsing error. Let's see what the build log shows this ti
